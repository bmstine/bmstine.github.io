            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil to a skillet and put on low heat while you prepare your fish filets. Grab both red snapper filets and set them on a large cutting board. Make sure all scales are off and keep the skin on. Make 2 slices into the skin at an angle towards the middle of the filets, just enough to go through the skin and touch the flesh. Sprinkle both filets with kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Then lightly coat each filet with all-purpose baking flour. Pat seasoning and flour gently into the filets on both sides. Gently add each filet into your skillet skin side up. Turn your burner up to medium-high heat. Cook for 4 minutes, flip gently, cook for 4 more minutes. Remove filets and let them rest lightly covered with tinfoil on a plate.<em>TIP: I like to store my food in the microwave or oven while resting for over 5 minutes.</em>

                    Safely remove excess oil in the pan. Wash broccolini in cold water pat dry with a tea or paper towel. Keep broccolini whole and add to your skillet keep at the same temperature used for the filets. Lightly salt and toss while cooking for 5 minutes. Remove and rest with your fish. No oil is needed here because the skillet will still be coated with oil from the filets, which is also now more flavorful.

                    Change the heat on your burner to low. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 6 tablespoons of butter, and 4 tablespoons of capers to your skillet. Stir, and cook until butter is completely melted. Plate your filet and broccolini in the center of your plate and only drizzle the filet with the caper sauce. Don't worry it will get underneath your broccolini. Slice your lemon into thick wedges and serve plated. This allows you and anyone else eating this delicious dish to control the acidity.
