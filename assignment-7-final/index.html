            <h2>Guest Reviews</h2>

            <blockquote>“We live in an apartment in Downtown Austin, and my boyfriend loves bbq and cooking. Unfortunately we don’t have a yard, so he can’t grill. I found a beautiful cabin at Bear Creek Cabins that has a grill and smoker. I booked in for a week as a surprise and he spent all weekend smoking a bunch of meats. He was so happy!” <span class="name">- Daisy M.</span></blockquote>

            <blockquote>“I was on call for half of our vacation and needed to hop on my laptop a few times, the high-speed internet was great and reliable. I wouldn’t have been able to go on vacation without it. Bear Creek Cabins fit my whole family’s needs.” <span class="name">- Steve K.</span></blockquote>

            <blockquote>“Bear Creek Cabins was a perfect getaway for my wife and me. We live in New York and it’s so cold right now here in December. We were looking for some warmer weather and Texas provided just that. It was so refreshing to get out of the house for the week and explore nature. The weekly rate discount was a big incentive as well.” <span class="name">- Gary U.</span></blockquote>
