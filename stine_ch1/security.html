            <h2>Education on Web Security</h2>

            <p></p>Web security is immense in today's times. Some web users may not even know any security exists, some web users think everything is secure, and some people completely avoid the web because they think nothing is secure. Fortunately, web security does exist, and with today's technology, it's safer than it has ever been. Most of the work is done for us and built-in by the companies that develop the products, our web browsers. The developers that make the websites we use also have built-in security features. Such as firewalls, data backups, SSL certificates, and password control. Most of these features an average user may not notice but they are there working in your favor. </p>

            <p>Even with all the technology features modern develops use, we still play a major part in our own security. All users should be careful of information shared on the web from credit card information to personal information, like addresses, birthdays, and social security numbers. </p>

            <p>A great way for the average user to check if a website is secure is to look for HTTPS, the S at the end of HTTP stands for Secure. HTTPS means the website is encrypted and has that extra layer of security. Think of it this way, HTTP is like talking in a public place with a friend, everyone can hear what you're saying. Now, think of HTTPS as if you were talking in a made-up language only you and your friend understand. Everyone can still hear you but they won't be able to understand it. </p>

            <p>Take a look below for an example of what information is obtainable right now from your computer.</p>

            <h3>Example of Information Obtainable</h3>
            <!--id for appName-->
            <p id="name"></p>
            <!--id for appVersion-->
            <p id="ver"></p>
            <!--id for onLine-->
            <p id="line"></p>
            <!--id for platform-->
            <p id="plat"></p>
            <p><b>Your screen information is...</b></p>
            <!--id for pixelDepth-->
            <p id="pix"></p>
            <!--id for height-->
            <p id="tall"></p>
            <!--id for width-->
            <p id="wide"></p>
